# Journal Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on experimenting with analysis and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications using data from personal or health journals. The goal is to explore methods for extracting meaningful insights, generating summaries, and leveraging LLMs to process and analyze journal entries in novel ways.

## Objectives

- Implement techniques for natural language understanding and processing on journal data.
- Experiment with RAG to augment journal analysis by combining retrieval systems with LLMs.
- Develop workflows for summarizing, categorizing, and extracting key information from journal entries.
- Explore potential applications for self-understanding, health tracking, and retrospective reflection.

## Data

- The journal data is stored locally in the **data** folder (excluded from Git).
- Entries are formatted with timestamps and are organized by date, providing rich context for analysis and time-series applications.

## Methodology

1. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Clean and format the raw journal data.
   - Tokenize entries and prepare the data for NLP tasks.
   
2. **LLM Integration**: 
   - Utilize pre-trained language models to generate insights and summaries from the journal data.
   - Test the efficacy of LLMs in extracting themes or patterns from personal writing.

3. **RAG Experimentation**:
   - Implement a retrieval system to pull relevant journal entries based on specific queries.
   - Combine the retrieval system with a language model to generate contextualized responses or insights.

## Future Work

- Fine-tune models on the journal data for personalized analysis.
- Explore additional NLP techniques such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis.
- Integrate visualization tools to graph trends over time (e.g., changes in mood, health patterns).

## Repository Structure

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks containing the experiments related to journal data analysis and RAG applications.
- **Data**: Raw and processed journal data (excluded from Git) used for the experiments.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for data preprocessing and integrating LLMs with retrieval systems.
- **Documentation**: Notes and detailed descriptions of the experiments and their outcomes.
